🧾 Script 1: rce.py
====================

📌 Purpose:
Exploits Laravel RCE vulnerability by using a known APP_KEY to generate a malicious payload that leads to remote code execution. If successful, it writes a backdoor to the server and logs the URL.

🛠 How It Works:
- Reads a list of targets in the format: http://target.com|base64:APP_KEY
- Crafts a signed and encrypted payload using AES and HMAC
- Sends the payload via the XSRF-TOKEN cookie
- Writes a PHP backdoor to the web root
- Verifies if the backdoor is accessible

📥 Usage:
1. Prepare a file (e.g., targets.txt) with lines like:
   http://example.com|base64:your_app_key_here

2. Run the script:
   python rce.py

3. Enter the input filename when prompted

📁 Output:
Successful backdoor URLs are saved in:
   ENV-TO-RCE/Result_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt

📦 Dependencies:
- requests
- urllib3
- colorama
- pystyle
- pycryptodome

Install with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

🧾 Script 2: envtobase64.py
============================

📌 Purpose:
Scans a list of URLs for exposed Laravel .env files and extracts the APP_KEY. Useful for reconnaissance and preparing targets for rce.py.

🛠 How It Works:
- Reads a list of .env URLs
- Fetches each URL and checks for valid .env content
- Extracts the APP_KEY if present
- Saves results in the format: http://target.com|base64:APP_KEY

📥 Usage:
1. Prepare a file (e.g., env_urls.txt) with lines like:
   http://example.com/.env

2. Run the script:
   python envtobase64.py

3. Enter the input filename when prompted

📁 Output:
Extracted APP_KEYs are saved in:
   ENV-TO-RCE/Result_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt

📦 Dependencies:
- requests
- urllib3
- colorama
- pystyle

Install with:
pip install -r requirements.txt
