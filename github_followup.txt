Subject: FOLLOW-UP: Strategic Takedown Suggestion for whereveryouare666 Malware Repos

Dear GitHub Trust & Safety Team,

This is a follow-up to my recent abuse report regarding user whereveryouare666
and their malware repositories (linuxsys, 0xShell).

STRATEGIC SUGGESTION BEFORE DELETION:

Instead of immediately deleting the repositories, you have a unique opportunity
to NEUTRALIZE THE ENTIRE BOTNET by modifying the config.json file first.

The botnet works as follows:
- Infected servers fetch config.json from GitHub every 60 seconds
- The "watch": true parameter means bots automatically apply config changes
- All bots are currently mining for the attacker

PROPOSED ACTION:

Before deleting the repo, modify the file:
https://github.com/whereveryouare666/linuxsys/blob/main/config.json

Change it to:

{
  "cpu": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "pools": [],
  "background": false,
  "watch": true
}

EFFECT:
- "cpu.enabled": false → All miners STOP immediately
- "pools": [] → No pool to connect to
- "watch": true → Bots will apply this config automatically

Within 60 seconds, EVERY infected server worldwide would stop mining.

The attacker loses control of their entire botnet before they can react or
set up alternative infrastructure.

THEN delete the repositories and suspend the account.

This approach:
1. Immediately stops the criminal activity
2. Protects all current victims
3. Prevents the attacker from pivoting to backup infrastructure
4. Demonstrates proactive security response

TIMELINE:
1. Modify config.json (takes 30 seconds)
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for bots to fetch new config
3. Delete repositories
4. Suspend account

Thank you for considering this approach.

Best regards,
